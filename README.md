# DS210_FINALPROJECT
For this project on Reddit data, I used a dataset from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection which
contains embeddings of Reddit users and subreddits. I am interested in this dataset because
the social media platform is one I frequently use, so I am personally interested in finding
connections within the app. I also think finding the distances between different nodes in this
dataset would be insightful in determining what interests can be grouped together, which could
be unpredictable.

The data is linked here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-RedditEmbeddings.html and is also uploaded to this repository.
